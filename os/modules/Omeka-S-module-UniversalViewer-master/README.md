Universal Viewer (module for Omeka S)
=====================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-UniversalViewer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-UniversalViewer)

[Universal Viewer] is a module for [Omeka S] that integrates [UniversalViewer],
a unified online player for any files, so it can display books, images, maps,
audio, movies, pdf, 3D, and anything else as long as the appropriate extension
is installed. Rotation, zoom, inside search, etc. may be managed too.

It uses the resources of any [IIIF] compliant server. The full specification of
the "International Image Interoperability Framework" standard is supported
(level 2). If you don’t have an [IIPImage] server, Omeka S can be one! Just
install the module [IIIF Server].

The Universal Viewer was firstly developed by [Digirati] for the [Wellcome Library]
of the [British Library] and the [National Library of Wales], then open sourced
(unlike the viewer of [Gallica], the public digital library built by the [Bibliothèque Nationale de France], which is sold to its partners).

This [Omeka S] module is a rewrite of the [Universal Viewer plugin for Omeka] by
[BibLibre] with the same features as the original plugin, but separated into two
modules (the IIIF server and the widget Universal Viewer).

See a [demo] on the [Bibliothèque patrimoniale] of [Mines ParisTech], or you can
set the url "https://patrimoine.mines-paristech.fr/iiif/collection/7"
in the official [example server], because this is fully interoperable.


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename module folder "UniversalViewer".

Then install it like any other Omeka module.

If you don’t have an IIIF Server, install the module [IIIF Server].

If you need to display big images (bigger than 1 to 10 MB according to your
server), install the module [OpenLayersZoom], a module  that convert big images
like maps and deep paintings, and any other images, into tiles in order to load
and zoom them instantly.

Some options can be set:
- Options for the integration of the player can be changed in the config page.
- Options for the UniversalViewer player can be changed in the json file
  "config.json": copy and update it in a folder named "universal-viewer" inside
  the folder of the theme.
- To use an alternative config for some items, add an option `config` with
  its url in the array of arguments passed to the viewer (see below), or use a
  metadata in the field set in the IIIF server config form.

See below the notes for more info.

* Javascript library "UniversalViewer"

Since version 2.2.1, the distribution release of the javascript library [UniversalViewer]
is included in the folder `asset/js/uv/`. If you want a more
recent release, clone the last [distribution] in the same directory. "nodejs",
other packages and any other files are not needed, because only the viewer is
used: the IIIF server is provided directly by the module itself. A gulp script
is provided too.

* Adaptation of the Universal Viewer config

To customize the configuration of the module, create a directory `universal-folder`
in your theme and copy the file `modules/UniversalViewer/view/public/universal-viewer/config.json`
inside it: `themes/My_Theme/view/omeka/site/universal-viewer/config.json`.

Details of the config options can be found on the [wiki] and tested [online].


Usage
-----

If the [IIIF Server] is installed, all resources of Omeka S are automatically
available by the Universal Viewer.

The viewer is always available at `http://www.example.com/item-set/{item-set id}/play`
and `http://www.example.com/item/{item id}/play`. Furthermore, it is
automatically embedded in "item-set/{id}" and "item/{id}" show and/or browse
pages. This can be disabled in the config of the module. Finally, a layout is
available to add the viewer in any standard page.

To embed the Universal Viewer, just use the helper:

```php
    // Display the viewer with the specified item set.
    echo $this->universalViewer($itemSet);

    // Display the viewer with the specified item and specified options.
    echo $this->universalViewer($item, array(
        'class' => 'my-class',
        'style' => 'width: 40%; height: 400px;',
        'config' => 'https://example.com/my/specific/config.json',
    ));

    // Display multiple resources (items and/or item sets).
    echo $this->universalViewer($resources);
```


Notes
-----

- If an item has no file, the viewer is not able to display it, so a check is
  automatically done.
- Media: Currently, no image should be available in the same item.
- Audio/Video: the format should be supported by the browser of the user. In
  fact, only open, free and/or common codecs are really supported: "mp3" and
  "ogg" for audio and "webm" and "ogv" for video. They can be modified in the
  file "routes.ini".
- The Universal Viewer cannot display empty item sets, so an empty view may
  appear when multiple resources are displayed.
- The display of 3D models is fully supported by the widget and natively managed
  since the release 2.3. 3D models are managed via the [threejs] library.
  Nevertheless, see the readme of the module [IIIF Server] for some possible
  additional requirements.


Bugs
----

- When an item set contains non image items, the left panel with the index is
  displayed only when the first item contains an image.

Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It's always recommended to backup your files and database regularly so you can
roll back if needed.
